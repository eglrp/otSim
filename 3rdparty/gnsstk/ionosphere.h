	/**
	\brief Given the user geodetic position, GPS time of week, the azimuth and elevation to the satellite
	in question, and the alpha and beta Klobuchar terms, compute the ionospheric delay for this
	satellite.

	\remarks
	- The ionospheric correction is referred to the L1 frequency; if the user is operating on the
	L2 frequency, the correction term must be multiplied by \n
	(f_L1/f_L2)^2 = (1575.42/1227.6)^2 = (77/60)^2 = 1.64694444...
