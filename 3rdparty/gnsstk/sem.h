	/// \brief  A limited set of satellite orbit parameters that is used to 
	///         calculate GPS satellite positions and velocities. In the 
	///         ephemeris structure below, the parameters for computing 
	///         satellite clock corrections are also included.
	///

	/// \date     2006-11-10
	/// \since    2005-08-15
	/// 
	/// \remarks
	/// (1) Struct packaging: compatible with 4 and 8 byte packing \n
	/// (2) The af0 and af1 parameters are typically from low precision sources like the true broadcast
	///     GPS almanacs. The af0 and af1 parameters are preferred from ephemeris download as they have
	///     higher precision. \n
