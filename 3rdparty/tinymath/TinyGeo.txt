Introduction
Welcome to the documentation of tinygeo. tinygeo is an geometric extension to the tinymath template library.
Features

    * extends the vector class
    * extends the matrix class
    * extends the quaterion class

Installation
The installation of tinygeo is like the installation of tinymath. As tinygeo is completely written as a c++ template too you don't have to compile anything at all. You should only copy the necessary files into your project that's all.

Supported compiler
At the moment the library works with this compilers

    * Visual Studio 6/7/8
    * Gnu/Gcc 3.3
    * Digital Mars

It would be very helpful if you can test it on other platforms and compiler. If you find bugs please tell me these so I can fix it.
